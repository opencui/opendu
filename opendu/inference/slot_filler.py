# There are two levels of the APIs here: a
# 1. assuming the entity recognizer is external,
# 2. assuming the entity recognizer is internel.
# The difference will be whether we include candidates in the API.
# We will be focusing on the #1 as #2 can be easily implemented with #1.
#
# There are many possible solutions for this:
# For example, question/answering based: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08848
