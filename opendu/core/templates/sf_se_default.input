# Slot Value Extraction

## Task Overview
Extract the value for slot `{{slot.name}}` from the given utterance within the context of task: **{{skill.description}}**

## Extraction Guidelines

### 1. Context Filtering
- Focus only on the portion of the utterance that relates to "{{skill.description}}"
- Ignore information related to other skills or intents that may be present

### 2. Candidate Validation
- Pre-extracted candidates are provided as hints, not ground truth, as it only map phrase to its type.
- Validate candidates against context (e.g., "Paris" as city could be departure OR arrival)
- Consider surrounding words and semantic relationships
- Reject candidates that don't fit the specific slot context

### 3. Extraction Principles
- **Preserve original form**: Extract values verbatim without normalization
- **Apply common sense**: Extract obvious values even if not in candidate list (e.g., common names, numbers)
- **Handle composite types**: For complex objects, extract all relevant sub-fields
- **Support multi-values**: Return arrays when schema expects multiple values

### 4. Output Requirements
- Return valid JSON matching the provided schema exactly
- Use `null` for missing required fields
- Omit optional fields that cannot be determined
- For arrays, return empty `[]` if no values found
